## [Unreleased]

### [2026-03-13]

#### Modified

- `app/(core)/contexts/AuthProvider.js`: Fixed a race condition where `isLoading` was set to `false` prematurely before token-based authentication completed. Now `isLoading` correctly waits for authentication promises to resolve.
- `app/theme/fgstore.mapp/home/components/BottomNavigation.jsx`: Synced bottom navigation active state with the current `pathname` and ensured the navbar is visible on the profile page.
- `app/(core)/contexts/AuthProvider.js`: Defined `MOBILE_APP_REDIRECT_PATH` for centralized redirection. Consolidated `isMobileApp` detection to include `theme === "mobile app"` and domain `fgstore.mapp`. Restricted `WebLoginWithMobileToken` to mobile app domains and ensured login pages are inaccessible for mobile app users.

### [2026-03-12]

#### Modified

- `app/(core)/contexts/AuthProvider.js`: Enhanced post-login redirect fix to be case-insensitive and move logic to `useEffect`. Added domain-specific restriction for the `nxtmobileapp.web` domain to prevent access to login/register pages.
- `app/(core)/contexts/MasterProvider.js`: Restored and refined token-based login logic for the `nxtmobileapp.web` domain, ensuring correct redirection to the home page or intended destination in mobile webview mode.

### [2026-02-27]

#### Modified

- `app/theme/fgstore.mapp/home/components/GiftBlock.jsx`: Refactored for performance and UI consistency. Removed unused state, added Header component, and improved image handling.
